        <h3 style="background-color:f1faee;">What is ice cream?</h3>
   <p>A <strong>mixture of dairy ingredients</strong> such as milk and nonfat milk, and ingredients for sweetening and flavoring, such as fruits, nuts and chocolate chips.</p>
        
         <blockquote>Real ice cream is made from 100% dairy â€“ milk, and products made from milk (including cream, skim milk powder, and whey powder)</blockquote>
        
        
    <p>The earliest evidence of anything approaching ice cream being made was <em>in China</em> in the Tang period (A.D. 618-907). Buffalo, cows' and goats' milk was heated and allowed to ferment. This 'yoghurt' was then mixed with flour for thickening, camphor (yes camphor!) for flavour and 'refrigerated' before being served.</p>

        <p>About 70% of the ingredients in ice cream come from milk, although mixes often contain natural ingredients like sugar and fruit.  

Small quantities of stabilisers, flavours, colourings and emulsifiers may also be added to enhance flavour, texture or appearance.

There are no added preservatives as ice cream is preserved naturally by freezing. As it freezes, the mixture is whipped and blended to give its smoothness...</p>
